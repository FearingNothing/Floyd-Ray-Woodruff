# Floyd-Ray-Woodruff
I'm Ray, a 47 year old recently divorced father of 6 living in Marshfield MO.  I enjoy video and board/card games, usually with my children, and also have an interest in woodworking and homesteading.  I have worked manufacturing a good portion of my adult life and am now looking to break into the tech field as I grow older.  To that end I am working through a course in Business Intelligence Analysis from TriplTen.  I am skilled in the usage of the programs most associated with that field, namely;
- Google Sheets (formulas and functions)
- Tableau
- Power BI
I am also skilled in the use of other programs not directly related but still worth noting;
- Microsoft Word
- Powerpoint
- Excel
- Various others

I am willing to participate in outsourcing projects and collaboration.
